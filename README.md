# Roadmap To Anything

For anything you want to learn, there are a lot of useful, but unconnected resources out there. Our platform lets people build gamified learning paths for each other called roadmaps.

## Usage

As soon as users land on the homepage, they will see a selection of amazing roadmaps built by our users. These roadmaps provide step-by-step instructions and links to resources for anyone who is interested in learning about a subject. If a user creates an account, they can track their progress, vote roadmaps up or down, and create some of their own.


## Development

### Installing Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and then from within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```
This will handle both client and server-side dependencies as outlined in [package.json](package.json) and [bower.json](bower.json).

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.


## Internal APIs
On any project the internal APIs are many, and generally undocumented. For ease reference, for both the development team and future contributers, they are exhaustively documented here.

### Test Data

In order to help test various aspects of Roadmap To Anything, test data can be seeded from [testData.json](specs/data/testData.json) into either the main database, or a seperate test database. This can be done with one of a few npm scripts:
```sh
npm run seed
```

Will seed the main database with test data, if it does not already exist.
```sh
npm run clear
```

Will remove the test data (but no other data) from the main database.
```sh
npm run reset
```

Will clear the test data, and then reseed it. Additionally, `-test` can be added after any of these calls to modify the test database instead of the main one. For example, before running any tests, `npm test` autmoatically runs the following command:
```sh
npm run reset-test
```

### DB Schema
There are three types of objects stored in the database. When retrieved from the server, all references to other database objects will be fully populated with complete objects. These objects have the following properties:

####[User](server/api/users/userModel.js)
```javascript
{
  username           :  ...   // String
  password           :  ...   // String
  firstName          :  ...   // String
  lastName           :  ...   // String
  imageUrl           :  ...   // String
  authoredRoadmaps   : [...]  // Array of Roadmap references
  inProgress.roadmaps: [...]  // Array of Roadmap references
  inProgress.nodes   : [...]  // Array of Node references
  completedRoadmaps  : [...]  // Array of Roadmap references
  created            :  ...   // Date
  updated            :  ...   // Date 
}

```

####[Roadmap](server/api/roadmaps/roadmapModel.js)
```javascript
{
  title      :  ...   // String
  description:  ...   // String
  author     :  ...   // User reference
  nodes      : [...]  // Array of Node references
  created    :  ...   // Date 
  updated    :  ...   // Date 
}

```

####[Node](server/api/nodes/nodeModel.js)
```javascript
{
  title        :  ...  // String
  description  :  ...  // String
  resourceType :  ...  // String
  resourceURL  :  ...  // String
  imageUrl     :  ...  // String
  parentRoadmap:  ...  // Roadmap reference
  created      :  ...  // Date
  updated      :  ...  // Date
}

```

### Server API
The server uses a stateless RESTful API to for all database access. It supports four HTTP verbs: `GET` for retrieving data, `POST` for creating new objects, `PUT` for updating existing objects, and `DELETE` for removing objects. All `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes require an authorization token, with the exception of `POST /api/signup`.

#### The Routes
Most routes follow a `/api/:data_type/:data_identifier` pattern. When an aspect of a route is prefaced with a colon `:` it refers to a variable. ALL of the following routes must be prefaced with `/api`.
```javascript
GET     /login                // Authenticate user
POST    /signup               // Create a user

GET     /users                // Get an array of users 
GET     /users/:username      // Get a specific user
PUT     /users/:username      // Update the user's info
DELETE  /users/:username      // Delete the user

GET     /roadmaps             // Get an array of roadmaps
GET     /roadmaps/:roadmapId  // Get a specific roadmap
POST    /roadmaps             // Create a new roadmap
PUT     /roadmaps/:roadmapId  // Update a roadmap
DELETE  /roadmaps/:roadmapId  // Delete a roadmap

GET     /nodes/:nodeId        // Get a specific node
POST    /roadmaps/:roadmapID/nodes // create a new node
POST    /nodes                // create a new node
PUT     /nodes/:nodeId        // Update a node
DELETE  /nodes/:nodeId        // Delete a node
```

#### Query Strings
In order to login the user, their credentials must be passed through the following query string appended to `/api/login`:
```javascript
?username=:username&password=:password
```

In addition the following query strings are supported on any of the nonspecific `GET` routes that send back an array of objects. Support for other query strings may be implemented at a later date.
```javascript
?sort=:property     // Sorts results ascending by the given :property
?sort=-:property    // Sorts results in descending order

?:property=:value   // Filters results for :property equaling :value
?:property=>:value  // Filters results for :property being greater than :value
?:property=<:value  // Filters results for :property being less than :value
```

### Client Services

A number of Angular factories have been built in order to centralize many common client-side tasks. In order to use these factories in a module, make sure they are properly injected. For example, to inject the User factory:
```javascript
angular.module('example.ctrl', ['services.user'])

.controller('DashboardController', ['$scope', 'User', function($scope, User){
  ...
}]);

```

The methods available on each factory are detailed below:

####[User Factory](client/app/services/userFactory.js) 
`services.user`<br>
Contains various methods for modifying and accessing data related to the currently logged in user. Most require the user to be authorized with an `authToken` stored in local storage.

**User.getData()**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
Returns a promise with a user object that contains all of the current user's data, with all fields fully populated.

**User.login( username, password )**<br>
With correct credentials, logs the user in, setting `user.username` and `user.authToken` to local storage. Returns a promise with the username and authToken.

**User.signup( user )**<br>
Signs up and logs in a new user. Takes a user object as a parameter. Returns a promise with the new user object.

**User.logout()**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
Removes the user's username and authToken from local storage.

**User.isLoggedIn()**<br>
Returns `true` if the user has credentials in local storage, `false` if they do not.

**User.followRoadmapById( roadmapId )**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
*aliases: followRoadmap, followMap, follow*<br>
Accepts a roadmap id, and adds that roadmap to the user's `inProgress` array. Returns a promise with the entire user object.

**User.unfollowRoadmapById( roadmapId )**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
*aliases: unfollowRoadmap, unfollowMap, unfollow*<br>
Accepts a roadmap id, and removes that roadmap to the user's `inProgress` array. Returns a promise with the entire user object.

**User.completeNodeById( nodeId )**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
*aliases: completeNode*<br>
Accepts a node id, and adds that node to the user's `inProgress` array. Returns a promise with the entire user object.

**User.completeRoadmapById( roadmapId )**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
*aliases: completeRoadmap, completeMap*<br>
Accepts a roadmap id, and adds that roadmap to the user's `completed` array. Removes the corresponding roadmap and nodes from `inProgress`. Returns a promise with the entire user object.

**User.getRoadmapProgress( [user], [roadmapId] )**<br>
_**!!requires authorization**_<br>
*aliases: getMapProgress, getProgress*<br>
Accepts a user object and/or a roadmap id. If no user is passed, then it will be fetched from the server, and a promise will be returned. If a roadmap id is passed then the progress data for the specified roadmap will be returned. If no roadmap id is passed, then an array with the progress data for all of the user's `inProgress` roadmaps will be returned. Progress data is formatted like this:
```javascript
{
  _id:        // The corresponding roadmap's id
  total:      // The total number of nodes in the roadmap
  completed:  // The number of nodes the user completed
  percentage: // A completion percentage, out of 100
}
```

####[Server Factory](client/app/services/serverFactory.js) 
_**'services.server'**_<br>
