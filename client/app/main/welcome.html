       <p>A Roadmap is an ordered collection of links with a brief description at each step. People from all over the world make them to help others lean a new skill or appeciation. They're easy to make, easy to search for, and make your learning process so much more effective than just surfing blog posts.</p>

With <i>Roadmap To Anything</i>, you create simple step-by-step paths to help others learn about any topic -- from bands to programming to birdwatching -- or earn points and badges for following a roadmap to learn something new yourself!</p>
