       A Roadmap is an ordered collection of links with a brief description at each step. People from all over the world make them to help others lean a new skill or appeciation. They're easy to make, easy to search for, and make your learning process so much more effective than just surfing blog posts.

        If someone asked you to teach them some skill, or if you wanted to share a new music artist with a friend, showing them one article or one song isn't going to cut it. It often takes a step-by-step process to truly learn or appreciate new things. With <i>Roadmap To Anything</i>, you create simple step-by-step paths to help others learn about any topic -- from bands to programming to birdwatching -- or earn points and badges for following a roadmap to learn something new yourself!
